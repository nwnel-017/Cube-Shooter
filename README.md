# CubeShooter
Nathan Nelson

This is a simple game I created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS

The idea of this game is to move the mouse to move your cube, and dodge the incoming enemies. If you hit a enemy with your cube, the game is over. If you click your mouse your cube fires a projectile that can destroy the oncoming enemies. Have fun!!
